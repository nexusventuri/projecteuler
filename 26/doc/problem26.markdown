A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
>1/2= 0.51/3= 0.(3)1/4= 0.251/5= 0.21/6= 0.1(6)1/7= 0.(142857)1/8= 0.1251/9= 0.(1)1/10= 0.1Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
Find the value of d ![&lt;][1]  1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
